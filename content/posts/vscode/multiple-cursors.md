I felt intimidated by multiple cursors the first time I heard about them. It's hard enough to edit in just once place. How can I edit in multiple places at once? It's one of those features that makes you wonder if you are a "real developer".

Multiple cursors aren't about making multiple edits at the same time. They are about making the same edit _in multiple places_ at the same time. The trouble is that it's hard to know _when_ you need them. 

## A multi-cursor exercise

My colleague John Papa devised a little exercise that will help you both learn how to use them, as well as how to recognize in the future when you need them.
